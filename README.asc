= Automated Release

Put your version control in autopilot and create good looking releases.

Don't waste time on every release searching what has changed on your software or on how to build a meaningful file for each version so your clients can see what's new. Only having https://www.docker.com/[Docker], you can handle all the release process in any OS. Just works!

And if you are using GitHub, make everything works on an automated way with https://travis-ci.com/[Travis-CI] (using a single file!).

== Getting Started

Coming soon.
